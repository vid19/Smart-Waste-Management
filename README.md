# Modelled a hardware implementation using IR sensor,Soil Moisture sensor,a servo motor,which controls the actuation of waste classification into solid and liquid waste.
# Ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the level of dustbins and sends email alert to if dustbin level is almost full.Using GPS sensor,location of dustbins can be found  and this data is loaded into the cloud using ThingSpeak.
# Raspbery pi 4b is used and RaspOs is written on SD card to code in python for the IR,Soil Moisture and Ultrasonic sensors. Matlab analysis of dustbin level data is done using ThingSpeak.
